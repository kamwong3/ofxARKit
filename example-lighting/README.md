#  example-lighting

A basic example of how to extract lighting information. you should see a simple sphere in the middle of your view with a white ambient light.

Depending on the lighting conditions of your environment, you should see things go from gray to white as conditions change.

Note that anchors aren't used in this, so the image will follow you as you move the camera.
